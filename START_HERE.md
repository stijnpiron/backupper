## 📁 Important Documents

### 🌟 Read First

1. **FINALIZED_DECISIONS.md** ⭐ **START HERE**
   - Complete summary of all decisions
   - Feature priority matrix (what's in MVP, what's not)
   - Technical decisions (ALL mode, basic verification, etc.)
   - Updated timeline and sprint breakdown
   - Platform abstraction architecture

2. **DOCUMENTATION_UPDATES_NEEDED.md** 
   - Action items for updating existing docs
   - Specific changes needed for each file
   - Recommended update order

### 📚 Core Documentation (Original)

- **USER_STORIES.md** - All user stories and tasks (needs priority updates)
- **ROADMAP.md** - Sprint-by-sprint timeline (needs reorganization)
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical design (needs platform abstraction details)
- **REQUIREMENTS.md** - Functional requirements
- **CHECKLIST.md** - Feature checklist (needs priority markers)

### ✅ Already Updated

- **REFINEMENT_QUESTIONS.md** - Marked as complete with decision summary

## 🎯 Key Decisions Summary

### Priority 1 Features (Must Have for MVP)
1. ✅ Incremental backups with hardlinks
2. ✅ Volume mount detection (external SSD workflow)
3. ✅ App quit detection (ALL mode)
4. ✅ **Manual backup trigger** ⬆️ (elevated to P1)
5. ✅ Retention management
6. ✅ Basic progress feedback
7. ✅ System notifications
8. ✅ Launch at login
9. ✅ Basic backup verification

### What Changed from Original Plan

#### ⬆️ Elevated to Priority 1
- **Manual Backup Trigger** - Essential for testing during development

#### 📅 Sprint Reorganization
- **Sprint 2**: Added Manual Backup Trigger (moved from Sprint 4)
  - Allows immediate testing of backup engine!
- **Sprint 4**: Removed Periodic Trigger (moved to Sprint 6)
  - Focus on critical triggers: App Quit + Volume Mount
- **Sprint 6**: Added Periodic Trigger
  - Priority 2 feature, not blocking MVP

#### 🎛️ Simplified for MVP
- **App Quit Mode**: ALL only (ANY mode → v1.2)
- **Verification**: Basic only (advanced checksums → v1.2)
- **First Run**: Minimal setup (wizard → v1.2)
- **Result**: Saved ~13 hours!

| 9 | Weeks 17-18 | Documentation + macOS Release | 12h |
| **Total** | **18 weeks** | **macOS MVP (v1.0)** | **~130h** |
| 10 | Post-MVP | Windows Port (v1.1) | +20h |

**Calendar Time**: ~4.5 months  
**Weekly Commitment**: 7-8 hours/week

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Tauri v2
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Rust
- **Target OS**: macOS 11+ (v1.0), Windows 10/11 (v1.1)
- **Filesystems**: APFS/HFS+ (macOS), NTFS/ReFS (Windows)

### Platform Abstraction

Code structured from day 1 for easy Windows porting:
- Platform-agnostic core backup logic
- Platform-specific implementations (NSWorkspace, DiskArbitration for macOS)
- Conditional compilation with `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]`

---

## 🎬 Next Steps

### Option A: Begin Coding Immediately
```bash
cd /Users/pirons/Documents/dev/backupper
# Sprint 1, Task 1.1.1: Initialize Tauri project
npm create tauri-app@latest
```

### Option B: Update Documentation First (Recommended)

1. Read **FINALIZED_DECISIONS.md** thoroughly
2. Follow **DOCUMENTATION_UPDATES_NEEDED.md** to update:
   - USER_STORIES.md (priority updates)
   - ROADMAP.md (sprint reorganization)
   - CHECKLIST.md (priority markers)
   - ARCHITECTURE.md (platform abstraction)
3. Then begin Sprint 1

### Option C: Ask Me to Update Docs for You

I can systematically update each documentation file with the finalized decisions. Just say:
> "Update all documentation files with the finalized decisions"

## ✨ What You Get in MVP (v1.0)

A fully functional macOS backup application that:
- ✅ Creates incremental backups using hardlinks (saves storage!)
- ✅ Triggers automatically when Lightroom quits (ALL mode)
- ✅ Triggers automatically when external SSD is mounted
- ✅ Shows progress and notifications
- ✅ Manages old backups with retention policies
- ✅ Runs in background with menu bar control
- ✅ Launches at login
- ✅ Verifies backups completed successfully

Perfect for your Lightroom Classic workflow! 📸

## 🔮 What Comes Later

- **v1.1**: Windows support, Periodic backups
- **v1.2**: ANY quit mode, Advanced checksums, Detailed progress, Log viewer
- **v1.3**: Multiple profiles, Exclude patterns, Restore functionality

---

## 💡 Quick Tips

1. **Manual backup is your friend** - Use it to test the engine in Sprint 2!
2. **ALL quit mode is simpler** - Perfect for single-app (Lightroom) workflow
3. **Basic verification is enough** - Advanced checksums can wait
4. **Platform abstraction pays off** - Windows port will be much easier
5. **Focus on MVP** - Don't scope creep! Stick to Priority 1 features
