## 🔄 Backup Strategy Explanation

### Incremental with Complete Snapshots

```
Initial Backup (Day 1):
target/backup_2025-10-22_100000/
├── photo1.jpg          [1 GB] - Copied
├── photo2.jpg          [1 GB] - Copied
└── catalog.lrcat       [500 MB] - Copied
Total disk usage: 2.5 GB

Incremental Backup (Day 2) - Only catalog changed:
target/backup_2025-10-23_100000/
├── photo1.jpg          [0 bytes] - Hardlinked to Day 1
├── photo2.jpg          [0 bytes] - Hardlinked to Day 1
└── catalog.lrcat       [500 MB] - Copied (changed)
Total NEW disk usage: 500 MB
Total APPARENT size: 2.5 GB (complete snapshot!)

Disk Space Saved: 2 GB via hardlinks! 🎉
```

### Retention Example

```
Settings: Keep 3 backups
Current backups:
1. backup_2025-10-24_100000  [Latest]
2. backup_2025-10-23_100000
3. backup_2025-10-22_100000
4. backup_2025-10-21_100000  [Oldest - will be deleted]

After new backup completes:
1. backup_2025-10-25_100000  [New - Latest]
2. backup_2025-10-24_100000
3. backup_2025-10-23_100000
   [backup_2025-10-22_100000 deleted automatically]
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **✅ Review all documentation**

   - Read through each document
   - Ask questions if anything is unclear
   - Confirm all requirements match your vision

2. **🔧 Set up development environment**

   ```bash
   # Install prerequisites
   # - Xcode Command Line Tools
   # - Rust
   # - Node.js
   # - Tauri CLI
   ```

3. **🎯 Start Sprint 1**
   - Initialize Tauri project
   - Set up project structure
   - Create menu bar app
   - Implement settings storage

### Development Approach

**Recommended**: Follow sprints in order

- Each sprint builds on previous work
- Natural progression of complexity
- Regular milestones for testing

**Alternative**: Pick specific features

- Implement backup engine first
- Add UI later
- More flexible but requires planning

## 💡 Key Design Decisions Made

Based on your requirements:

1. **✅ Tauri v2** (not Electron) - Better performance, smaller size
2. **✅ Hardlinks** - Save disk space, complete snapshots
3. **✅ Timestamp naming** - `backup_2025-10-22_143015` (user prefix)
4. **✅ Trigger on ANY quit** - Default, with ALL quit option
5. **✅ Immediate trigger** - No delay after app quit
6. **✅ Periodic option** - For local/internal sources
7. **✅ Manual trigger** - Always available
8. **✅ Failed backup recovery** - Discard and restart from last successful
9. **✅ Auto retention** - Delete oldest when limit reached
10. **✅ Comprehensive logging** - To file with UI viewer

## 🎓 Learning Path

If you're new to Rust but know TypeScript well:

**Phase 1**: Work on Frontend (React/TS)

- Settings UI
- Menu bar components
- Progress display
- Your comfort zone!

**Phase 2**: Learn Rust basics

- Follow "The Rust Book" chapters 1-10
- Focus on ownership, borrowing, error handling
- Practice with small examples

**Phase 3**: Backend Implementation

- Start with simple commands (get/set settings)
- File operations (read, copy)
- Gradually add complexity (async, monitoring)

**Parallel Learning**:

- Copy patterns from ARCHITECTURE.md
- Use AI assistance for Rust-specific questions
- Test frequently

## 📞 Questions to Confirm

Before starting development:

1. **Is the scope clear?** All 90+ requirements make sense?
2. **Technology stack OK?** Tauri + Rust + React + TypeScript
