## What is Backupper?

Backupper is a cross-platform desktop application designed to provide automated, incremental backups with intelligent triggering mechanisms. It lives in your system tray (macOS menu bar or Windows taskbar), monitors your system, and backs up your important data when you need it.

### Primary Use Case: Lightroom Classic Workflow

**Example Workflow (works on both macOS and Windows):**

1. Work on photos stored on external SSD
2. Edit in Lightroom Classic
3. When you quit Lightroom, Backupper automatically backs up your catalog and edits
4. Only changed files are copied - hardlinks save disk space for large photo libraries
5. Keep last N backups with full file history
6. Each backup is a complete snapshot you can browse and restore from

## Key Features

### ‚ú® Core Backup Technology

- **Incremental Backups with Hardlinks** - Only copies changed files, hardlinks unchanged ones
- **Complete Snapshots** - Each backup shows the complete file tree as it existed at that moment
- **Smart Retention** - Automatically manages old backups based on your rules

### üîÑ Smart Automatic Triggers

- **Volume Mount Detection** - Automatically backup when external drive is connected
- **Application Quit Monitoring** - Trigger backups when specific apps close
- **Periodic Scheduling** - Schedule regular backups (hourly, daily, weekly)
- **Manual Trigger** - Always available "Backup Now" button

### üñ•Ô∏è Cross-Platform Native Integration

- **macOS** - Menu bar app with native notifications and system integration
- **Windows** - System tray app with Windows notifications and native APIs
- **Platform-Specific APIs** - DiskArbitration (macOS), WMI (Windows) for system monitoring

### üéØ User-Friendly Interface

- **System Tray Living** - Unobtrusive, always accessible
- **Visual Status Indicators** - Icon shows backup status at a glance
- **Progress Tracking** - Real-time backup progress and statistics
- **Settings Management** - Easy configuration of all backup rules

### ‚öôÔ∏è Flexible Configuration

- Choose any source and target folders
- Select which apps to monitor
- Set retention policies (number of backups or time-based)
- Configure trigger conditions
- Enable/disable automatic startup

## How Backups Work

### Incremental Backup Strategy

```
target/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backup_2025-10-23_143015/    # Most recent (complete snapshot)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file1.txt                 # Copied (changed since last backup)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file2.txt                 # Hardlinked (unchanged)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ file3.txt                 # Hardlinked (unchanged)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backup_2025-10-23_120000/    # Previous backup
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file1.txt                 # Previous version
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ file2.txt                 # Original
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ file3.txt                 # Original
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ backup_2025-10-22_180000/    # Oldest backup (will be deleted per retention)
```

**How It Works:**

1. First backup copies all files
2. Subsequent backups only copy changed files
3. Unchanged files are hardlinked to previous backup
4. Each backup folder contains complete file tree (browseable snapshot)
5. Disk space only used for changed files

**Hardlink Benefits:**

- Massive space savings (especially for large media libraries)
- Fast backups (only copying changes)
- Each backup is independently browseable
- No complex restore process - just copy files back

### Backup Triggers

**1. Volume Mount Detection**

- Monitors for external drive connections
- Identifies drives by UUID (not just name)
- Triggers backup when source drive is connected
- Perfect for laptop + external SSD workflows

**2. Application Quit Monitoring**

- Select apps to monitor (e.g., Lightroom Classic, Photoshop)
- ALL mode (MVP): Backup when all monitored apps have quit
- ANY mode (v1.2+): Backup when any monitored app quits
- Handles app crashes gracefully

**3. Periodic Scheduling**

- Set backup intervals: hourly, daily, weekly, custom
- Only runs when system is awake
- Configurable quiet hours
- For internal/local sources

**4. Manual Trigger**

- Always available in system tray menu
- "Backup Now" button
- Useful for ad-hoc backups before important operations

## Performance Targets

Backupper is designed to be lightweight and efficient:

| Metric                   | Target  | Notes                      |
| ------------------------ | ------- | -------------------------- |
| Scan 10,000 files        | < 2s    | Initial scan before backup |
| Scan 100,000 files       | < 20s   | Large photo libraries      |
| Backup 1GB (initial)     | < 1 min | First full backup          |
| Backup 1GB (incremental) | < 5s    | No changes                 |
| Menu response            | < 100ms | Instant feedback           |
| Memory (idle)            | < 50MB  | Minimal footprint          |
| Memory (backup)          | < 200MB | During active backup       |

## FAQ

**Q: Why Tauri instead of Electron?**
A: Tauri is much lighter (~3MB vs ~100MB), uses less memory, and has better native system integration.

**Q: Why not use Time Machine (macOS) or Windows Backup?**
A: Backupper provides trigger-based backups (e.g., when app quits) and granular control over timing and retention that system tools don't offer.

**Q: How much disk space do I need?**
A: First backup needs space equal to source size. Incremental backups only need space for changed files thanks to hardlinks.

**Q: What happens if my filesystem doesn't support hardlinks?**
A: Backupper will detect this and ask if you want to proceed with full file copies or choose a different destination.

**Q: Can I restore individual files?**
A: Yes! Each backup folder is a complete snapshot - just browse it like any folder and copy files back.

**Q: Does this replace cloud backups?**
A: No - Backupper is for local backups. You should still maintain offsite/cloud backups for disaster recovery.

**Q: Will Windows support be exactly the same?**
A: Yes! Core functionality identical, with platform-native UI and system integration on each platform.
