## ‚≠ê UPDATED ROADMAP (Oct 22, 2025)

Based on finalized requirements, the roadmap has been reorganized for optimal development flow.

### Key Changes:
1. **Manual Backup Trigger** moved to Sprint 2 (from Sprint 4) - Essential for testing
2. **Periodic Backup Trigger** moved to Sprint 6 (from Sprint 4) - Priority 2 feature
3. **Timeline optimized** to ~130 hours (saved 13 hours through smart scoping)

---

## Updated Sprint Details

### Sprint 2: Core Backup Engine + Manual Trigger (Weeks 3-4) ‚≠ê UPDATED
**Goal**: Implement backup functionality AND manual trigger for immediate testing

**User Stories**:
- 3.1: Incremental Backup with Hardlinks (20 hours)
- **3.2: Manual Backup Trigger (8 hours)** ‚¨ÖÔ∏è MOVED FROM SPRINT 4

**Time Estimate**: 28 hours (was 20 hours)

**Key Deliverables**:
- Working backup engine with platform-abstracted file operations
- Hardlink support for unchanged files (APFS/HFS+ on macOS)
- File comparison and incremental logic
- **Manual backup button in UI** ‚≠ê
- **Basic backup verification (file count check)** ‚≠ê
- Ability to test backup engine immediately!

**Rationale**: Manual trigger is Priority 1 because it's essential for testing the backup engine during development. Moving it to Sprint 2 allows immediate validation of core functionality.

---

### Sprint 4: Critical Triggers - App Quit & Volume Mount (Weeks 7-8) ‚≠ê UPDATED
**Goal**: Implement the two critical automatic backup triggers for MVP

**User Stories**:
- 4.1: Application Quit Detection (ALL mode) (15 hours)
- 4.3: Volume Mount Detection (15 hours)
- **REMOVED: 4.2 Periodic Backup Trigger** (moved to Sprint 6)

**Time Estimate**: 30 hours (was 33 hours)

**Key Deliverables**:
- App quit monitoring with **ALL mode only** (backup when all monitored apps quit)
- Volume mount detection for external drives (critical for Lightroom workflow)
- App selection UI with browseable app picker
- Volume selection UI with dropdown of mounted volumes
- Trigger configuration in settings
- Notifications for triggered backups
- macOS-specific implementations (NSWorkspace, DiskArbitration)

**Technical Notes**:
- **ALL quit mode only** - Simpler than implementing both ANY and ALL
- ANY mode deferred to v1.2+ (not needed for single-app Lightroom workflow)
- Time saved: ~2 hours

---

### Sprint 6: System Integration + Periodic Trigger (Weeks 11-12) ‚≠ê UPDATED
**Goal**: Complete system integration and add scheduled backups

**User Stories**:
- 5.1: System Notifications (5 hours)
- 5.2: Launch at Login (6 hours)
- 2.4: Backup History (3 hours)
- **4.2: Periodic Backup Trigger (12 hours)** ‚¨ÖÔ∏è MOVED FROM SPRINT 4

**Time Estimate**: 26 hours (was 23 hours)

**Key Deliverables**:
- System notifications for backup events (start, complete, error)
- Launch at login functionality
- Backup history view with timestamps and status
- **Scheduled/periodic backup trigger** (hourly, daily, weekly)
- Complete MVP feature set

**Rationale**: Periodic trigger is Priority 2 (Should Have), not blocking MVP core functionality. Better to implement it after critical triggers are working and tested.

**Calendar Time**: ~18 weeks for MVP (~4.5 months)  
**Recommended Weekly Commitment**: 7-8 hours/week

---

## Post-MVP Feature Roadmap

### v1.1 (Sprint 10, +20 hours)
- ‚úÖ Windows support
- ‚úÖ Windows-specific implementations (WMI, Win32 APIs)
- ‚úÖ NTFS/ReFS hardlink support
- ‚úÖ Windows installer and code signing

### v1.2 (Future)
- ANY quit mode (trigger when any app quits)
- Advanced checksum verification (incremental)
- Detailed progress (per-file, speed, ETA)
- Log viewer UI
- Exclude patterns UI

### v1.3 (Future)
- Multiple backup profiles
- Restore functionality
- Cloud backup destinations
- Compression options

---

## Time Optimization Summary

**Original Estimate** (unfocused cross-platform): 145-150 hours  
**Optimized Estimate** (smart scoping): 130 hours  
**Time Saved**: ~15 hours

### How We Saved Time:
1. **ALL-only quit mode** (-2 hours): Simpler than implementing both ANY and ALL modes
2. **Basic verification** (-8 hours): Advanced checksums deferred to v1.2
3. **Minimal first run** (-3 hours): No wizard, just basic setup
4. **Sprint reorganization** (-2 hours): Better flow reduces context switching

These optimizations don't sacrifice quality - they focus the MVP on what's truly essential for your Lightroom workflow!

---

## Risk Mitigation Updates

1. **Manual Trigger in Sprint 2**: Allows early testing of backup engine, reducing risk of late-stage issues
2. **Critical Triggers First**: App quit and volume mount (Sprint 4) before nice-to-have periodic trigger (Sprint 6)
3. **Platform Abstraction**: Sprint 1 setup pays dividends in Sprint 10 Windows port
4. **Buffer Time**: Sprints 7 and 8 provide cushion for unexpected issues

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ Roadmap finalized and optimized - Ready to begin Sprint 1
